Hi there!

Please feel free to use any of the scripts I make available here.

Please do always check the code yourself and validate it can do no harm to your environment. Do not just execute and YEET! it ;-).

I take no resposibility if the script(s) seem to break something in your environment, although having it break something will never be the intention.

Kind regards,

Kevin
